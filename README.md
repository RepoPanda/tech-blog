# tech-blog

## Description

My motivation for this project was to practice and learn to use the MVC paradigm in a full-stack application. I built this project for developers, so they can share their blog posts and also comment on other developers’ posts. This project uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Installation

You can install this project by cloning the repository from [My Github Repo](https://github.com/RepoPanda/tech-blog) and run npm install to install the dependencies. You will also need to create a .env file with your mysql username and password. Then you can run npm start to start the server and navigate to localhost:3030 to view the application.
